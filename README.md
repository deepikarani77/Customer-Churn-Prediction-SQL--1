**Project Name: Customer-Churn-Prediction SQL Project using Actions and Operations**
    
ðŸš€ **Problem Statement**
	
-	Businesses often lose customers due to poor service, pricing, or other factors. Predicting customer 
churn (who is likely to leave) is critical for retention strategies. But messy data (with redundancy, anomalies, and poor design) makes analysis harder.
We solve this using Database Normalization & SQL for clean, efficient data storage and insights.

ðŸš€ **Solution**

-	We designed a normalized database schema for the churn dataset, created tables, applied SQL queries, 
       and demonstrated real-time database concepts (DBMS, RDBMS, SQL commands, normalization).

ðŸš€ **concepts used in this project.**

-	Define data, data table, database, DBMS
-	Difference between sql and mysql
-	Importance of sql
-	Types of db
-	Difference between dbms and rdbms
-	Difference between Table, view, Relationship
-	Sql commands 
-	Difference between drop and truncate.


ðŸš€ **Goal**: 

-	Understand Database Normalization in churn datasets.
-	Implement SQL queries for customer churn insights.
-	Demonstrate DBMS fundamentals with real-world tasks.

ðŸš€ **Tech stack**: 

-	Database: MySQL
-	Data: Customer Churn Dataset
-	Tools: MySQL Workbench / CLI

ðŸš€ **Tech Used**

-	MySQL Queries (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)
-	Database Normalization (1NF â†’ 3NF)
-	Entity-Relationship Model

ðŸš€ **Key skills shown**: 

- SQL Query Writing
- Database Design & Normalization
- Customer Churn Domain Knowledge
- Problem-Solving with DBMS Concepts


ðŸš€ **What I did in this project**?

-	Designed Customer Churn Database Schema
-	Normalized tables to remove redundancy
-	Wrote SQL queries to showcase DBMS concepts
-	Solved real-time anomalies

ðŸš€ **What I learnt**?

-	How SQL differs from MySQL
-	Different types of databases (RDBMS, NoSQL, etc.)
-	How to optimize queries using SQL commands
-	The difference between DROP vs TRUNCATE

ðŸš€ **What is impact**?

ðŸ“Š Businesses can use this structured churn database to:
-	Reduce churn rates ðŸ“‰
-	Improve retention strategies
-	Run predictive models on clean, normalized data


ðŸš€ **Skills Used**

-	SQL (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)
-	DBMS & RDBMS
-	Normalization & ER Modeling
-	Analytical Thinking
