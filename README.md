**ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Customer Churn Prediction (SQL Workflow)**

Designed a SQL workflow on the Customer Churn dataset covering:

1. DQL: Query churned customers with high charges
2.  DDL: Normalized tables (Customers, Contracts)
3. DML: Insert, update & delete records
4. DCL: Role-based access control
5. TCL: Safe transactions with commit/rollback

Showcasing my ability to structure, query & secure relational databases.
